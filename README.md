# Weather-App

This is a responsive weather app, utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data from a city and display it. This app includes an input field for the user to enter a city name. The user has the option of viewing the results in imperial or metric units. This is a simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript based project with a focus on utilizing an API.
 
### Prerequisites

For this project you will need an API key of your own from https://openweathermap.org/.
